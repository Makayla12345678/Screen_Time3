# Product Context

## Why this project exists
To help the user track their habit of limiting screen time (specifically a 30-minute limit) by gamifying the process with a streak counter.

## Problems it solves
- forgetting to track daily progress.
- lack of visual motivation to stick to limits.

## How it should work
- The user opens the app.
- If they succeeded in their goal for the day, they click "+".
- The streak increases and the fire icon lights up.
- The app remembers the streak for the next visit.
- If they miss a day, the streak resets automatically.

## User Experience Goals
- Minimalist, dark-themed UI.
- Immediate feedback (animations, color changes).
- Simple interaction (two buttons).
