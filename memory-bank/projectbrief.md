# Project Brief: Screen Time Streak

## Overview
A simple web-based application to track a "Screen Time Streak". The user aims to limit screen time (implied 30-min limit based on UI text) and marks each successful day to maintain a streak.

## Core Requirements
- Display current streak count.
- Visual feedback (Fire icon) indicating streak status.
- "Day Complete" button to increment streak.
- "Reset Streak" button to clear progress.
- Persist data using local storage.
- Auto-reset logic if a day is missed.

## Goals
- Provide a simple visual motivator for limiting screen time.
- Run as a standalone HTML file without complex backend requirements.
